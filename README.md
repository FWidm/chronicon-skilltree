# ChroniconSkilltree

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.
@Faust I'm putting a secret command (ctrl+s+j) in the game as of next update to print a json file with all skill data - should make your work easier :)

## Todo
- Add search function for nodes and their tooltip
- Add functionalities to share trees via links
- Tooltips should not leave the viewport!
- Switching between skills in one slot needs to be supported
  - Show switcher if skill is levelled down to 0! (shift)
  - remove skill from dict if it was removed by this option.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
